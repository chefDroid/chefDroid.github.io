  <!-- Intro -->
  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      I build automation and security-focused systems with an emphasis on reliability,
      restraint, and long-term maintainability. My work focuses on understanding how
      systems behave under real-world constraints such as incomplete data, failure,
      and operational risk.

  <section>
    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Automated Trading Systems</h3>
      <p>
        Designed automated trading systems with deterministic execution,
        explicit risk controls, and operational guardrails. Integrated multiple
        third-party APIs to compensate for incomplete datasets while maintaining
        uninterrupted operation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Security Research & Reverse Engineering</h3>
      <p>
        Reverse engineered systems to understand undocumented behavior and rebuilt
        components with structured logging and improved debuggability. Completed
        ethical security labs and Capture the Flag challenges via TryHackMe.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Accessibility-Focused Security Tools</h3>
      <p>
        Built privacy-conscious security tools designed to operate without
        subscriptions, service lockouts, or forced online dependencies, including
        offline-first monitoring behavior.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>AWS Cloud Infrastructure</h3>
      <p>
        Designed cloud infrastructure with cost discipline, least-privilege access,
        autoscaling, and active monitoring using CloudWatch and cost analysis tools.
      </p>
    </div>

  <!-- Principles -->

    <h2>Principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reliability is a feature</li>
      <li>Simplicity reduces risk</li>
      <li>Security starts with least privilege</li>
      <li>Automation requires guardrails</li>
      <li>Systems should fail safely</li>
